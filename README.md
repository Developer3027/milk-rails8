# MILK-00

This project is my little informal little corner of the internet. It includes many projects that I have been working on over the past many years. Built in Rails, I continue to work this project daily. This project serves to showcase what I can do as a designer and developer as well as be both a client hub and learning center.

## Feature Projects
There are many projects I love and keep coming back to. With Rails I have been able to get them pulled together into one place to enjoy. Here is some information on each.

### Salt and Tar
This is a YouTube channel for sailing. Ruth and Garret have built Rediviva and the channel starts from the very beginning. Like many content creators, they juggle several accounts on various platforms. I thought they could use a site / app that gav them features they would use and enjoy while reducing the account overhead. This is a concept, of course I hope everyone enjoys, and all there information is provided so you can easily support them. If I am honest, having just that home page that includes all those support links in one place, is an improvement.

### Hermit Plus
Minecraft is a thing. The Hermits have really made it a thing to enjoy. This group of talented players have figured it out. I wanted a different way to enjoy them. Wanted them pulled together into one location. Like Netflix, but with only the Hermits. One YouTube they are spread out in all the noise. Then there is the fan art, the merch, the music for some. They deserve something more.

### Copywriter
This project and Barbershop were old Wordpress projects that I just loved the design. Several months back I started the clean up of my LinkedIn and decided to remake this one as all the others were lost. It then moved to here as I wrapped everything together. I did a little research and found a copywriter and decided to rebuild their site with my design. This is a concept but they are real. Wether you love or hate my work, I encourage you to give them a look.

### Blog
I have recently started a SubStack account. I finally have this blog up and running. This is intended to help me and others, learn these concepts as I continue this journey. They will provide a glimpse of both my sense of humor and knowledge of design and development.
