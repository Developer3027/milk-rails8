<h1 id = "welcome-to-milk-00">Welcome to MILK-00</h1><div>My name is Mason Roberts and known as Developer 3027 in all my code. I am an automotive technician during the day. This includes shop management and training employees as well as tending to the automotive needs of my customers. On my days off and in the evening, I am Developer 3027 and work on learning and growing as a web engineer.<br><br>
</div><h1 id="overview">Overview</h1><div>Over the past year, 2024, I focused on learning Ruby on Rails. I find the platform a joy to work with. Unlike other frameworks, Rails is the real deal with that one stop, full service functionality. I love that it's approach to the Model View Controller methodology (MVC) is so straight forward. I also love that with Turbo you can provide the same feel and style one may want from a framework like React. Rails provides for both the Frontend and Backend and includes a Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that ensures working with a relational database like PostgreSQL is a dream. Need to add a column to the database? Bam! Need to change it so the reference id can be false? Bam! Just create and run that migration.<br><br>
</div><h1 id="main-reason">Main Reason</h1><div>I have built this web app to demonstrate what I can do, not only in Rails, but as a developer and designer. I also wanted a few things for myself on the internet. I have several ideas that are in various stages of build in other frameworks. Here with Rails I have brought them all together in one place for everyone to enjoy. This has been a challenge for sure. Each project should look and feel like it is it's own site and all be managed from the central admin dashboard. In the end I want to be able to simply lift the site out of MILK and place it on it's own in the world, with minimal effort. What kind of projects am I talking about?<br><br>I have enjoyed the Hermits of Hermitcraft for many years. Season 8 was especially good and thought that they would benefit form there own spotlight. YouTube is an amazing platform and the Hermits have used it to great advantage, but I would have loved to had better, more organized, access to them.&nbsp;<br><br>I love Garret and Ruth of Salt and Tar. The boat they have built called Rediviva is just amazing. I always thought that they would have benefited from a bit of different functionality in there site. As with many content providers, they are spread across several different platforms. I would like to help all content providers out with that, but first, I built a site I think they would really enjoy. At the minimum, I will.<br><br>These are just a few of the projects I am working through. This blog is for telling the story of building such a thing, and maybe someone will learn from my experience. Welcome and enjoy your stay.</div>
