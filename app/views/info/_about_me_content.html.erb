        Automotive technician by trade with over 20 years experience. Web developer with nearly 10 years experience. Rails focus for the past 4 years. I know the javascript ecosystem and use it in Rails but have developed with React and Node. These days I use PostgreSQL but know MongoDB as well. I use Claude Code and have various scripts built to help both with the studio and code. I also use Gemini both in the browser and with the CLI tool. For design I use Figma in the browser and Krita on my Linux Thinkpad running PoPos these days. I am well versed in Git as well. Most of my apps have some kind of AWS or AZURE integration.

        I have a Substack and Patreon for the studio as I continue to build out this platform. Most of my time these days are taken up with a automotive rewards and flash sale app, as well the various other personal projects I hope to launch with the studios support. Soundscape is a true passion. That music player is a lot of fun. Hermit Plus has been a dream for such a long time. It has been partially built in both React and Next.
