## Root Function.
The app is comprised of several apps in one. The root is a simple layout with links. The top link is the blog. Light / dark mode toggle to the left and info toggle to the right. Dark mode will default to the browser of operating system via tailwind. About half the links on the root are informational links but many can point directly to either the project or client. Each of those direct links can also have information sections on the info page. The info toggle will toggle the links to either info or direct.

Some of the links on root may need a lot of explaining where others will run shallow. I decided to provide one info page for all links and build specific sections for the links. This will be re-evaluated as I go.

### employer
The employer section is for those looking to hire me for employment and will include my resume as well as other information that I need to provide to someone who is looking to hire me for a job. Now that the Figma design is in progress, this page will need a model. This page will include badges and project cards.

### client
The Client section is for those who are looking to hire me to build a project for them. The info toggle will take them to the information page where links to Fivver and Upwork as well as reasons to hire me, are located or the sign in if they are a client. Here there is a dashboard with info on the site build, issues tab where they can create a issue. A internal email where they can email me in house. A chat option if I am logged in.

You removed the info toggle and added the admin mug icon. Ade devise an ran install. Removed the registerable from the milk_admin model. Need to create seed for milk_admin and create dashboard, fix routeing.
